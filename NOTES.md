# Packages
- package.json referenced the "mongo" package instead of the "mongodb" package; the latter is the official MongoDB driver for Node, and is what I assume was intended.
- Installed ts-node-dev for ease of local development.
- Installed dotenv for loading .env file contents into environment variables.
